<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About SLD

SLD helps to accelerate deployment, weighting and making IaaC reusable, generating dynamic forms and maintaining different variables in each environment with the same code. With SLD you can schedule infrastructure deployments like its destruction, manage users by roles and separate stacks by squad and environment


![Product Name Screen Shot](img/dashboard.png)


![Product Name Screen Shot](img/api.png)

Main features:
* Fast API async
* Dashboard / UI
* Distributed tasks routing by squad
* Infrastructure as code (IaC) based in terraform code
* Dynamic html form from terraform variables
* Re-deploy infrastructure keeping the above parameters
* Distributed architecture based microservices
* Task decouple and event driven pattern
* Resilient, rollback deployment and retry if failure

SLD is the easy way to use your terrafrom code!






<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need docker and docker-compse or kind ( recomended ).
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/es/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Installation

1. Clone the SLD repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/D10S0VSkY-OSS/Stack-Lifecycle-Deployment.git
   ```
2. Deploy SLD in k8s with kind
   ```sh
   cd Stack-Lifecycle-Deployment/play-with-sld/kubernetes 
   sh kplay.sh start
   ```
   Result:
   ```sh
   Starting SLD for play
   Creating cluster "kind" ...
   ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.20.2) üñº
   ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶ üì¶  
   ‚úì Writing configuration üìú 
   ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è 
   ‚úì Installing CNI üîå 
   ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ 
   ‚úì Joining worker nodes üöú 
   Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
   You can now use your cluster with:

   kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
      ```

3. Create init user

   ```sh
   sh kplay.sh init
   ```

   Result:

   ```bash
   kind ok
   docker ok
   kubectl ok
   jq ok
   curl ok

   init SLD

   #  Now, you can play with SLD üïπÔ∏è                #

   DASHBOARD: http://0.0.0.0:5000/

   ```

   List endopints

   ```sh
   sh kplay.sh list

   Result:

   ```bash

   ```
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
1. Sign-in to [DASHBOARD:](http://0.0.0.0:5000/)

    ![sign-in](img/sign-in.png)
    
    Click the dashboard link:

    ![sign-in](img/welcome.png)

    

2. Add Cloud account


    ![sign-in](img/account.png)

    fill in the form with the required data.
    in our example we will use
    
    * Squad: squad1 
    * Environment: develop
    
    > by default workers are running as squad1 and squad2 for play purpose, but you can change it and scale when you want
    
    finally add:
    * Access_key_id
    * Secret_access_key
    * Default_region ( default eu-west-1)
    In case you use assume role, fill in the rest of the data.

3. Add terraform module or stack
   
    ![sign-in](img/add_stack.png)

    * Name: Add the name with a valid prefix according to the cloud provider. 
    > Prefixs supported: aws_ , gcp_, azure_
    * git: Add a valid git repository, like github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc. in our case to play we use (https://github.com/D10S0VSkY-OSS/aws_vpc_poc)
    > You can pass user and  password as https://username:password@github.com/aws_vpc
    > For ssh you can pass it as a secret in the deployment to the user sld
    * Branch: Add the branch you want to deploy by default is master
    * Squad Access: Assign who you want to have access to this stack by squad
    > '*' = gives access to all, you can allow access to one or many squads separated by commas: squad1,squad2
    * tf version: indicates the version of terraform required by the module or stack
    > https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/
    * Description: Describe the module or stack to help others during implementation. 
  
4. Deploy your first stack!!!
   
   List stacks for deploy
   
   ![sign-in](img/deploy_1.png)
   
   Choose deploy 
   
   ![sign-in](img/deploy_2.png)
   
   SLD will generate a dynamic form based on the stack variables,
   fill in the form and press the Deploy button

   ![sign-in](img/deploy_3.png)

    > Important! assign the same squad and environment that we previously created when adding the account (See Add Cloud account)

    Now, the status of the task will change as the deployment progresses.

   ![sign-in](img/deploy_4.png)

   You can control the implementation life cycle
   ![sign-in](img/deploy_5.png)
   You can destroy, re-implement that SLD will keep the old values ‚Äã‚Äãor you can also edit those values ‚Äã‚Äãat will.
   ![sign-in](img/deploy_6.png)
    And finally you can manage the life cycle programmatically, handle the destruction / creation of the infrastructure, a good practice for the savings plan!!!
